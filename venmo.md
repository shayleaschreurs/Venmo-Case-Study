# Venmo: Solutions to Competing In a Crowded Market

A Case Study by: Shaylea Schreurs


## What Is Venmo?

> Venmo is an open banking app that allows for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. This means that it is a third party payment service that connects to your bank, and allows for convenient transfers of money from you to your peers (or visa versa). Venmo was founded in 2009 by Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail, who met as roommates at the University of Pennsylvania. The idea of sending money to peers via mobile phones came to them in the form of a series of epiphanies when a few minor inconveniences presented themselves in their everyday lives. While helping their friend start up a yogurt shop, they had the idea of creating a type of POS system that would solve some problems that traditional POS systems had. In another instance, while attending a jazz concert, they dreamed of purchasing a copy of a digital music file via text message. Finally, their idea was really put into action when one of them forgot their wallet during a trip, causing considerable inconvenience when it came time to settle the debt. Their original plan was to find a way to send money via SMS, but eventually they landed on creating a smartphone app. In May 2010, they got to work and raised $1.2 million of seed money mostly from a venture capital fund, RRE Ventures. Later, in 2012 Venmo was bought for $26.6 million by Briaintree, and almost a year later, it was purchased for $800 million by its current owner, Paypal. 



## Business Activities

> Today Venmo is known as the app that you and your friends or family members use to split the bill when you go out to the movies, dinner, concerts, bars, and almost anything else you can think of. This adds an organic layer of security. What’s the likelihood of your best friend scamming you? As of 2021, Venmo has grown to over 70 million users, handled \$230 billion in transactions, and has generated $850 million in revenue. Why has Venmo grown so exponentially in popularity? For one, millennials seem to enjoy the ease of use. The social media-like layout makes for a fun way to track expenditures. There’s a sense of amusement to see and allow others to see your emoji filled memos. It creates a sort of buzz around the app that, in turn, creates a larger community of users. Transactions can also be kept completely private for those who may not want to share their spending habits with the world. Additionally, the app allows for recurring expenses, for example, your monthly share of rent due. One of the key reasons Venmo is so successful is it doesnt charge its users to send and receive funds, except when purchase protection is added to a transaction.

> What are the technologies in the background that make Venmo possible? Possibly one of the most important is Braintree. Braintree is a full stack payment system that makes it possible to accept payments within an app or website. It’s a tech-forward payment service provider with an impressive suite of dev tools, designed to scale along with your company. The way it works within Venmo is that it serves as a payment gateway. It collects the user data, authorizes any transactions sent, and allows approved funds to be sent to the correct user account in the Venmo app. 


## Landscape


> As mentioned above, Venmo falls into the categories of p2p payments, and open banking. Some of the biggest competitors within these domains include Paypal, Cashapp, Zelle, and Apple Pay. Most of these companies have implemented peer-to-peer, customer-to-business, or business-to-business money transactions. Almost all of them allow users to open up a debit card, credit card, or both. A recent trend that has been popping up within these domains is the idea to use these apps to buy and hold cryptocurrencies. The convenience of spending and sending money has created more of a willingness to do so. It’s also made it more possible for people to make purchases that they otherwise wouldn’t, whether it’s because they don’t have cash, forgot their wallet, or simply have a few bucks on their venmo balance. This in turn has had a positive effect on the economy. 

> Companies in the p2p payment sector strive to improve upon three major metrics; revenue, payment volume, and number of users. Venmo has been extremely successful with growth in all three areas. If you look at revenue, you’ll see that they’ve gone from $160 million to $850 million from 2017 to 2021. Venmo generates revenue through a 2.9% transaction fee for businesses and a 1% fee for instant money withdrawals. In order to get more revenue, of course they would need to improve on the volume of payments, which they have. From 2014 to 2021, the annual payment volume within venmo has increased by nearly 100 times, going from $2.3 billion to $230 billion. A key factor that affects an increase in volume is the number of users. It makes sense that the volume jumped so much in a seven year span because the number of users has also increased greatly. In the same span of time, Venmo went from less than 3 million users to about 70 million users. Now, this all seems like some impressively large growth, but compared to some of its top contenders, Venmo still has potential for a lot more growth. Below is a table that shows approximately where Venmo stands in comparison to a few other companies in its sector.

|Company | Revenue | Volume | Users |
|--- | ------- | ------ | ----- |
|Venmo |$850M  | $230B| 70M  |
|Paypal |$25.37B|$1.25T|392M|
|Applel Pay|>$1B|$90B|>500M|
|CashApp|$625M|$167B|>36M|
|Zelle|NA|$490B|>86M|

> As you can see, Venmo’s numbers are much, much smaller than that of its parent company, Paypal. Cashapp is the only contender in this chart that Venmo wins in every category. The good news for Venmo is that it is still doing well among some of the best in its category, and there are even some possible solutions that can be applied to allow for even greater growth in the future. 

## Recommendations

> Let’s look at some changes Venmo could make in order to improve upon the three key metrics previously discussed. What are some products or services that the competitors offer that venmo doesn’t? We’ll discuss some major game changers that Apple Pay and Paypal utilize. A huge one for Apple Pay is the touch-to-pay feature at in-store, and gas station POS terminals. Just touch your Apple product to the terminal and your transaction is complete. It works just as easy, if not, easier than using a debit card. Let’s take a look at Paypal. Almost anytime someone shops online, there’s an option at checkout to pay with Paypal. This beats entering in a card number almost every time. All the user has to do is type in a Paypal password, and the transaction is complete. This removes the inconvenience of having to stand up, retrieve your card, and enter in the card information. These features are unique, convenient, and appealing to users. If Venmo implemented just these two features into the app, it would open up a huge opportunity to increase the number of users, volume of payments, and most importantly, revenue. It would open the door to allow users to make many more purchases through merchants in person and online.

> Apple Pay uses a technology called NFC to enable touch-to-pay transactions. NFC enables two electronic devices to communicate over a distance of 4cm or less. NFC has evolved from RFID technology, which is seen in credit card chips, and is more fine-tuned. One aspect of Paypal is that it can act as a PSP much like Braintree which was discussed above. Just like Braintree, a payment gateway is linked to your processing network and account. What Paypal has done is in order to make it common to “Pay with Paypal” at checkout on many online stores, is that it simply has incorporated a button that pulls money from a Paypal user’s account in the same way that a checkout would otherwise pull money from your bank account. What Venmo would need to do in order to offer these features to its users, is to adopt these technologies. Would that be possible? When it comes to NFC technology, that’s a long shot. The reason NFC technology works with Apple Pay is because Apple has the mobile devices to make it possible. Venmo has attempted to compete in this realm by releasing a card that gives the user the ability to touch-to-pay, but it’s just not quite as convenient as having an all-in-one device. In order for Venmo to be able to use NFC technology with mobile devices, they would need to partner with a company that provides the devices. What would Venmo need to do to offer their users the option to checkout at online stores? As a mobile app, it seems it would only be possible as of now to make this work when making purchases from a mobile device. It would need to work with Braintree, Paypal, or become its own PSP to connect to websites and enable a button that would draw funds from a user's Venmo account. Website owners would need to become aware of this option to make a Venmo checkout button become the norm. Would it be in the best interest of Venmo’s competitors to lend a hand in helping it become capable of enabling these technologies? Probably not, but nothing is impossible.
